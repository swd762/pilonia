                                    construction is achieved using a gantry style printer. A gantry style printer operates under the same guiding
                                    principles as a typical plastic 3D printer ubiquitous in additive manufacturing, meaning, printable material is
                                    extruded one layer at a time until an overall structure is complete using a unique, preset design that is either
                                    cumbersome or impossible to achieve using traditional construction techniques. To print homes, the
                                    deposited material is mortar, and the final structure will form the inner and outer shells of a home’s exterior and
                                    interior walls. These shells will then be filled with standard construction materials to ensure structural integrity,
                                    insulation, and other properties requisite for habitation depending on local climate, regulation, and permit
                                    requirements.

                                    Pilonia is an eco-system where we remotely control the process of our robots and printing
                                    homes. We start with our own 4D/3D printer, and we are already in the process of releasing
                                    our own data and remote-control mixing unit. All our eco-system robots have the functionality
                                    to share data that we plan to use later in our AI system, and we can control them remotely.
                                    We plan to implement sensors into construction, as we use 2D nanomaterials. Using 2D nano
                                    materials not only allows us to save cost and materials, but also to print better homes that have
                                    various beneficial properties: withstand hurricanes, earthquakes and wind; protect from UV;
                                    benefit from salt and water resistance; and possess anti-cracking properties. Additionally,
                                    the graphene that we use in the process is produced from natural materials, is eco-friendly,
                                    and does not use any chemicals.

                                        The fixed formwork is printed using sand-concrete mixtures and the walls are filled with cellular concrete. You can also use concrete
                                        strength-increasing additives such as graphene, which reduces the amount of cement in the mixture while maintaining its strength properties.
                                        In the future, we plan to utilize other construction materials like recycled plastic, hemp, clay, rice, wood and others.

                                        We use different smart coatings on our 4D/3D printed process: thermo where in hot weather conditions it is colder inside and in cold weather
                                        it is warmer inside; anti-bacterial coating, especially for special purpose buildings; anti-static coating; sound protection; wave and
                                        magnetic protection coatings.

                                        Why use graphene in 4D printing?

                                        Adding graphene into concrete, by even a small amount such as 0.5 %, increases compression strength by 25-75 %, flex strength by 15-25 %,
                                        water permeability up to 85 %, improves sun, water, salt resistance, as well as anti-cracking properties of concrete.
